This is the ultimate OBS settings guide with the BEST OBS settings for streaming Fortnite, Just Chatting APEX Legends, PUBG, or really ANY game.

I debated buying a new Mac due to its limited options for expandability. This all changed when I found a way to not only rackmount my Mac, but add PCIe slots to add additional components like NVMe SSDs, video capture cards, dual 10 gig networking, and even testing a video card.

Thank you to Sonnet for sending this xMac Studio / Echo III / M.2 8x4 Silent Gen4 PCIe Card to help complete my video editing / software development Machine!

Disclosures:

- I was not paid
- I chose Sonnet and contacted them after researching alternatives
- SSDs are on loan and will be sent back
